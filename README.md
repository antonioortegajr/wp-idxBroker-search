# Search IDX Broker via API

This plugin searches the IDX Broker Rest API. This endpoint is in place, but only has access to fake MLS a00.

This is the dummy data set from IDX Broker.

This DOES NOT access real MLS data. There is only fake data returned.

Standard Disclaimer: This code is not official IDX Broker code. It does use their API, but in NO WAY is it supported by IDX Broker. DO NOT contact IDX Broker for any support of this code.

## Use

Download and upload to your WP install.

### Required

* Valid IDX Broker client API key
* Valid IDX Broker Developer Partner API key
